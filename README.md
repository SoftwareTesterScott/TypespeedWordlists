# TypespeedWordlists
A collection of wordlists usable by the program typespeed v0.6.5 

Wordlists created according to the rules:
The first line contains the Description (not more than 60 chars)
Word list contains atleast 22 different words, no longer than 19 characters, no duplicates, no escape sequences, tabs or spaces
Blank lines are ignored


on my install, the wordlists are located in /usr/share/typespeed/words and filenames are in the format of "words.<name>" (EG: words.eng, words.unix, words.cshartp_with_operators)

  Chess
  ----- 
A quick wordlist was made for chess as a proof of concept. Each word starts capitalised for consistency and although "en passant" is two words, spaces arent allowed, so "En-passant" it is.
